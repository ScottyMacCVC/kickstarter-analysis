# An Analysis of Theater Launch Outcomes

## The data collected has been sorted to identify favorable theater launch outcomes.  

### The analysis will help identify the best month & goal amounts. These are chosen for high success rates and will be helpful in planning future launches.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- **Two Conclusions for Theater Outcomes by Launch Date**
- The months of May & June show an increase in successful launch outcomes when compared to the other months. The data supports launching a theater project in these months would provide the highest success rates. The theater success rates decline beyond May and it is inadvisable to launch during the Winter months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- **Outcomes based on Goals Conclusions** 
- We expect a high percentage chance of success with smaller goals. Although we need to verify the reasons why we see a spike in success between $35,000 & $44,999 range, goals under $10,000 will likely return a successful outcome.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
- **The Limitations of this Dataset**
- Although the charts indicate a target time of year & a goal target ceiling, we need to identify and correlate the goal amounts with the launch date. There may be an optimized month with a higher likelihood of a larger goal. We also want to make sure we don't leave money on the table. If a goal was set too low and the event exceeded the goal by a considerable amount, a successful outcome isn't necessarily the best measurement. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- **Recommended Graphs for Further Research**
- A stacked bar graph for successful campaigns would show the total goal amounts in a single month and the individual goal amounts within. The months would be the X-axis, the outcome amounts would be the Y-axis, and the various outcomes by $ goal amount would make up the bar.
