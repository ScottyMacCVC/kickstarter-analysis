# An Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
## Overview of Project: The analysis will help identify the best month & goal amounts. These are chosen for high success rates and should be referenced when planning future launches.

## Two Conclusions for Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
### The months of May & June show an increase in successful launch outcomes when compared to the other months. The data supports launching a theater project in these months would provide the highest success rates. The theater success rates decline beyond May and it is inadvisable to launch during the Winter months. 
### The images below reflect the impact of theater. Please note the uptick in succesful campaigns during the months of May & June.

## Outcomes based on Goals Conclusions 
### ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://github.com/ScottyMacCVC/kickstarter-analysis/blob/CHALLENGE-01/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch-Correction.png) 
### We expect a high percentage chance of success with smaller goals. Although we need to verify the reasons why we see a spike in success between $35,000 & $44,999 range, goals under $10,000 will likely return a successful outcome.
## The Limitations of this Dataset
### Although the charts indicate a target time of year & a goal target ceiling, we need to identify and correlate the goal amounts with the launch date. There may be an optimized month with a higher likelihood of a larger goal. We also want to make sure we don't leave money on the table. If a goal was set too low and the event exceeded the goal by a considerable amount, a successful outcome isn't necessarily the best measurement. 
## Recommended Graphs for Further Research
### A stacked bar graph for successful campaigns would show the total goal amounts in a single month and the individual goal amounts within. The months would be the X-axis, the outcome amounts would be the Y-axis, and the various outcomes by $ goal amount would make up the bar.
