## Two Conclusions for Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
### The months of May & June show an increase in successful launch outcomes when compared to the other months. The data supports launching a theater project in these months would provide the higehst success rates. The theater success rates decline beyond May and it is inadvisable to launch during the Winter months. 
## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
## What are some limitations of this dataset?
## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
